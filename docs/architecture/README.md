# Feather Chat Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive architectural analysis of the Feather Chat application, utilizing Mermaid diagrams to illustrate the recursive and emergent nature of the system's cognitive architecture. The application demonstrates distributed cognition patterns through its modular design and adaptive attention allocation mechanisms.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Cognitive Flow Architecture
The system implements a hypergraph pattern encoding where each component serves as a cognitive kernel, processing and transforming information through recursive pathways.

### 2. Adaptive Attention Allocation
The architecture dynamically allocates computational resources based on user interaction patterns and system state, demonstrating emergent cognitive behaviors.

### 3. Neural-Symbolic Integration
The application bridges symbolic (UI components) and neural (AI model integration) processing through well-defined interfaces and state management patterns.

### 4. Emergent System Behaviors
Through component composition and state management, the system exhibits emergent properties that transcend individual component capabilities.
